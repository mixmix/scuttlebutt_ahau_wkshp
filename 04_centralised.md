## centralised

[[ DRAWING ]]

(draw database, business logic, ui)

pros:
- does all the heavy lifting in center, remote devices can be light
- easy to code logic
- network effect - attention = reality / dominicance
- great for building huge SaaS businesses around

cons:
- single point of failure
- doesn't work well "offline"
- walled garden (you're in or you're out)
- unlikely you get a say in governing you
- you are probably the product
- huge global database

questions:
- where is the database?
- who owns this and what sort of money funded this?
