[[ DRAWING ]]

(draw database, business logic, ui)

pros:
- heavy lifting is spread out => resiliant
- not owned by any single entity
- can work offline
- plurality of applications / subjectivity

cons:
- harder to build logic for
- each device has to do more work
- harder to govern
- you can't extract money as easily (e.g. you can't insert ads)
- deleting is hard

questions:
- where's the data stored?
- who is governing the data storage?
- who governs changes to communication protocols, how?
- what do the creators appear to care about?
